## Make a small project

**Note: this section is work in progress**

#### Using your installed programming language, make small program.

I suggest makeing 'commandline' apps that print text in the commandline and ask for input from the commandline.

**Make a ‘command line’ application in your chosen language - Suggestions:**

- A greeter app which asks for a name and then greets that person.

- A pizzeria app that presents you with a list of pizzas you can order and allows you to choose one. Maybe you can even choose multiple pizzas. When you are done selecting it will tell you how much your order costs.

- A quiz app that asks questions and then checks if the answer you give are correct. Maybe you can even play with multiple people and it will keep score!


#### You need to find out:
- How to run a program using your language. e.g. for ruby you can prefix your program with 'ruby' in the commandline and it will run:
`$ruby myprogram.rb`. Google how to run a program in your language.

- How print text to the commandline
- How to get input from the user from the commandline. Some languages use a function named `prompt` or `readline` to do this. Ruby uses `gets`
