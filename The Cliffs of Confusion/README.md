# *The Cliffs of Confusion*

The Cliffs of Confusion is a more adventurous trip for budding programmers who are familiar with some of basic programming concepts. This trip focuses on getting familiar with some professional programming tools and practices.

Like an actual skiing trip you might have to get used to falling down and getting up again. When making your own programs for the first time dealing with bugs is a matter of googling and persevering. You can do it!
