  Warmup exercise: Objectifying!

  A big part of programming is to describe real life situations and things
  in terms of data. This is called 'data modelling'.

  Let's say we're going on vacation. How can we describe what a vacation 'is'?
  It might contain the following:
  - The people going on the vacation
  - The date when the vacation starts
  - The number of days the vacation will last
  - The destination
  - The schedule of travelling to the destination
  - What we are going to do when we're there

  Now the challenge becomes to make a good translation from these properties
  to the right 'data-types'

  There are a lot of data-types in the world of programming so we'll start with
  some simple ones.

  Strings: represents textual data such as names. Denoted bij '' or ""
  example 'Danny'

  Numbers: represents a numerical value
  example 2018

  Boolean: true or false

  Array: A collection of data with a specific order. Denoted by []. A comma
  separates each item in the collection.
  example: ['Breakfast', 'Lunch', 'Dinner'] (this is an Array of strings)

  Object: A collection of properties with value. Denoted by {}. A comma
  separates each item in the collection.
  example: {
    name: 'Rein',
    age: 30,
    alive: true,
    jobs: ['tutor','teacher', 'programmer'],
  }

  Today's exercise
  - You've received some kind of object or situation
  - You're goin to model it in JSON (javascript object notation)
