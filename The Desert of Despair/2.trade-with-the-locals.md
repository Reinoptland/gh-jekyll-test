# Trade with the Locals - Use an api

Imagine you can ask someone a question. And responds really quickly an with a lot detail. And he never gets tired of answering your questions. That is kind of what an api is like.

An api is interface with a web-application which you can use to request data. It's like a url you enter in your browser but instead of responding with a website it responds with data.

There are all kinds of APIs which are publicly accessible. You can very easily make a request to them. That's what we're going to try.

**Start**

1.) Make a request to a public api. We will request what rockets were launched by SpaceX from their api.

**Ouch! that looks kind of hard to read!**
The data condensed to be as small as possible.
But computers can read it this way no problem

2.) Use one of the following tools to be able to view the data you get in a pretty way

**Chrome extension**
